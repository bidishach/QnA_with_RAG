Augmenting GPT Turbo's knowledge with custom data to build QnA pipeline

## What is RAG?
RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.

LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model’s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

LangChain has a number of components designed to help build Q&A applications, and RAG applications more generally.

## RAG Architecture
A typical RAG application has two main components:

Indexing: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline.

Retrieval and generation: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.
